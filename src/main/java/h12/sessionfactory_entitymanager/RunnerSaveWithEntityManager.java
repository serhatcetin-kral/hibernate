	 		There are two ways to handle persistence in Hibernate: Session(Hibernate) and Entity Manager(JPA).
	 		
	 1) EntityManagerFactory is  the standard implementation, it is the same across all the implementations. 
	    If we migrate our ORM for any other provider, there will not be any change in the approach for handling the transaction. 
	    In contrast, if you use hibernate’s session factory, it is tied  to hibernate APIs and cannot migrate to new vendor easily.
	    
     2) One dis-advantage of using the standard implementation is that, it is not providing the advanced features. 
        There is not much control provided in the EntityManager APIs. 
        Whereas, hibernate’s SessionFactory has lot of advanced features which can not done in JPA. 
        
        Looking into the above points, one has to decide which one is better. 
        There is no hard rule, after all it depends on the developers requirement.

		     You can prepare several entity manager factories to access several data stores. 
		     This interface is similar to the SessionFactory in Hibernate.

		     the "META-INF/persistence.xml" file in the classpath.
