				 TO CONFIGURE SECOND LEVEL CACHE
				 
					 1)Add to pom.xml
					 	<dependency>
						    <groupId>net.sf.ehcache</groupId>
						    <artifactId>ehcache-core</artifactId>
						    <version>2.6.11</version>
						</dependency>
					    
					    <dependency>
						    <groupId>org.hibernate</groupId>
						    <artifactId>hibernate-ehcache</artifactId>
						    <version>5.4.23.Final</version>
						</dependency>
						
					  2)Go to hibernate.cfg.xml file and do the followings
					     <property name="hibernate.cache.use_second_level_cache">true</property> 
					     //Bu asagidaki adresi Maven dependency jar file icinden bulduk
					     <property name="hibernate.cache.region.factory_class">org.hibernate.cache.ehcache.internal.EhcacheRegionFactory</property>
					     
			  		  3)To the Students07 class you need to add @Cacheable and @Cache(usage = CacheConcurrencyStrategy.READ_ONLY) 
			  		    annotations below the @Entity annotation
